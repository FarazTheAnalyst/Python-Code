An end-to-end machine learning solution that predicts salary ranges based on job characteristics, experience level, location, and education.  
This project covers the complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model development to API deployment and a user-friendly web interface.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a machine learning system to predict salary ranges.  
- Implemented data preprocessing, multiple model comparisons, API deployment, and interactive web app.  
- Designed with a focus on real-time usability and interpretability.  

---

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture
**Data Processing:** Cleaned and preprocessed salary data using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`, handling missing values and outliers.  
**Model Development:** Compared Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression; selected **Random Forest** for best performance.  
**API Development:** Built RESTful API using **FastAPI** for real-time salary predictions.  
**Web Interface:** Developed an **interactive Streamlit app** with input forms and salary visualization.  
**Feature Importance:** Implemented model interpretation to identify key factors influencing salary.

## 🏆 Key Achievements
- Achieved **R² = 0.97** and **MAE = $3,700** with Random Forest.  
- Engineered a full ML pipeline from data collection → deployment.  
- Delivered an interactive **web interface** with salary progression visualizations.  
- Optimized feature selection for **interpretable, business-relevant insights**.
